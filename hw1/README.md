This is my solution using asyncio. I hadn't realized during initial implementation that
the code returned wouldn't work on the actual ctf site. As it turns out my multiprocess solution
was working as well, it was just very slow.

To see that (not needed / no pressure to do so), go to personal_work_dir/pycharm_project/1.4/hw1/hw1.py
